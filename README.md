# ⚡️ Natanael Zamfir: Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🛡️

I’m an aspiring Cybersecurity Engineer focused on detecting threats, stopping attacks, fighting cybercrime, and protecting digital identities. Through hands-on projects in threat detection, incident investigation, and security monitoring, I’ve developed practical skills that mirror real SOC and blue-team environments.

### 🚨Threat Hunting and Security Operations

- **[🚨Threat Hunting Competition: Azuki Dead in The Water 🌊](https://github.com/natanael-zamfir/threat-hunt-azuki-d-in-the-water)**
> In this threat hunt competition, I conducted an end-to-end threat hunt and incident response investigation, reconstructing a real world ransomware attack by analysing endpoint telemetry to identify initial access, lateral movement, recovery destruction, persistence, anti-forensics activity, and final impact.

- **[Threat Hunting Scenario: Tor Browser Usage Detection](https://github.com/natanael-zamfir/threat-hunt-lab-tor-browser)**
> In this threat hunt scenario, employees at a fictional company were suspected of using the TOR browser to conduct unauthorised or potentially illegal activities. I conducted a threat hunt to identify the responsible employee, the device used, and verified evidence confirming TOR browser installation and active usage.



### 🛡️ Vulnerability Management Projects

- **[🖥️ Enterprise Vulnerability Management Program (End-to-End Lab)](https://github.com/natanael-zamfir/enterprise-vulnerability-management-program-end-to-end-lab/tree/main)**
> In this project, I simulate the implementation of a comprehensive vulnerability management program, from inception to completion.
- **[STIG Implementations: Windows 11 v2r5 + MITRE ATT&CK Mapping](http://github.com/natanael-zamfir/stigs-windows-11-implementation)**
